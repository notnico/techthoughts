    <h3>How the Tech Industry has Affected the Bay Area</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="articletext">
  <p><strong><br>If you ask someone what they think of when the words “Bay Area” come to mind, they might say something like the iconic skyline of the Golden Gate Bridge, the weathered walls of the Stanford Campus, or a walk down San Francisco’s Chinatown. However, they will more likely say something about the Tech Industry. Something about Apple, Google, or Twitter. After all, the Tech Boom in the past few decades has absolutely transformed the Bay. But to truly understand how deeply the Tech Industry has affected this pristine area, we need to dive way back into the start of it all.<br><br><br>
The Bay Area first became well known in the 1840s. When James W. Marshel discovered gold in the nearby American River, people frantically started moving to California from across the country and world, looking for the new-found wealth of gold. People arriving from across the world, particularly China, would arrive at the port of San Francisco. Numerous ships would arrive daily, further fueling the growth of the area. Industries were established and grown to support the new migrants, such as hospitals, bars, and clothing companies (if you’ve ever had a pair of Levi Strauss Jeans, thank the gold rush). Following the Gold Rush, California was granted state status in the United States, which helped the entire state grow even more.<br><br><br>
In the turn of the 20th century, The Bay was more hustling and bustling then ever; but that would all soon change. In 1906, a large earthquake with an epicenter near San Francisco hit the area. Immediate casualties were in the hundreds, and the entire city and much of the surrounding area was mostly reduced to rubble as fires caused by the earthquakes erupted. The US Geological Survey estimates that over 28,000 buildings were burned down in the earthquake and the fires after it. However, San Francisco would build back stronger then ever. Bankers and other high-class people sent loans to people and the city to re-build, and by 1915 the city was rebuilt and advertising itself to the world at places such as the Panama Pacific Convention.<br><br><br>
While early 20th century San Francisco was bigger then ever, the surrounding area, as well as the Bay peninsula (sometimes known as Silicon Valley) was still mostly rural farmland and small townships. As the population of the area grew, orchards and farms would gradually turn into sleepy suburbs. When tech companies like Atari started popping up in the late 1970s, this change started happening faster. The last orchard in the peninsula town of Sunnyvale closed down in 2000, with no space left in the dense suburbia of the Bay Area’s peninsula.<br><br><br>
Now that you have a simple understanding of the history of the area, it’s time to bring the tech influence into it. <br><br><br>
A San Jose (a city in Silicon Valley) house was worth only $155,000 in 1986, with much of the city being surrounded by farms and rural land at the time. Today, the same house would be worth $923,000, a $786,000 increase. Even adjusted to inflation, this is an extremely high increase. The reason for such a large increase? The wealth of tech companies established since then. Companies like Apple, Uber, Twitter, and Facebook have brought trillions of dollars and millions of well-payed people, pricing out Bay natives. Cities in the Bay have ran out of space to build single-family homes, and refuse to build high density housing. However, the cities decide to let large tech companies build huge campuses while often paying little taxes. Obviously, this would cause a housing crisis.<br><br><br>
The tech industry has affected the Bay in many ways. The large campuses and tax-evasion practices that the companies often use contribute to a housing crisis, as well as the well-payed tech workers pricing out native individuals. But at the same time, the Bay Area has been transformed into a world-renowned center of innovation. Do the pros of the transformation the industry has caused outweigh the cons?
